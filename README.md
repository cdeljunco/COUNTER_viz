# COUNTER_viz

## About
COUNTER_viz is a data visualization tool that enables libraries to upload TRJ1 files to get a sense of which journals are being utilized to makeÂ appropriate cost-benefit decisions. The application uses [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html) to develop interactive graphs where the user can zoom and hover for the best user experience. The website was developed using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), an open source app framework in Python language. 

<br />
